# FastAPI Learning Roadmap

This roadmap will guide you through learning **FastAPI** from beginner to advanced levels, covering key topics and concepts.

---

## **Beginner Level**

### 1. Introduction to FastAPI
- What is FastAPI, and its features.
- Installing FastAPI and Uvicorn.
- Creating your first FastAPI app.
- Understanding `@app.get()` and `@app.post()`.

### 2. Basic Routing
- Defining routes (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`).
- Path parameters and query parameters.

### 3. Request and Response Models
- Using Pydantic models for request validation.
- Returning JSON responses.

### 4. Dependency Injection (Basics)
- Introduction to FastAPI's dependency injection.
- Creating and using basic dependencies.

### 5. Interactive API Documentation
- Using Swagger UI and ReDoc.
- Exploring the auto-generated OpenAPI schema.

### 6. Form Data and File Uploads
- Handling form inputs.
- Uploading and serving files.

### 7. Basic Error Handling
- Returning custom error messages.
- Using `HTTPException`.

### 8. Environment Setup
- Setting up a local development environment.
- Running the server using `uvicorn`.

---

## **Intermediate Level**

### 1. Advanced Routing
- Using path and query parameters together.
- Path operations with the same paths but different HTTP methods.

### 2. Request and Response Handling
- Handling custom headers and cookies.
- Returning custom HTTP responses.
- Streaming responses.

### 3. Authentication and Authorization
- Implementing OAuth2 with Password (Bearer Token).
- Basic authentication.
- Using third-party libraries like FastAPI Users.

### 4. Dependency Injection (Intermediate)
- Nested dependencies.
- Dependency overrides.

### 5. Background Tasks
- Scheduling tasks in the background.
- Using `BackgroundTasks`.

### 6. Middleware
- Writing custom middleware.
- Common use cases (e.g., logging, security).

### 7. Database Integration
- Connecting to relational databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) using SQLAlchemy.
- Using NoSQL databases like MongoDB with ODM libraries.

### 8. Testing
- Writing unit tests with `pytest`.
- Testing API endpoints using FastAPI's `TestClient`.

### 9. Static Files
- Serving static files (CSS, JS, images, etc.).

### 10. Asynchronous Programming
- Understanding async and await in FastAPI.
- Building fully async APIs.

---

## **Advanced Level**

### 1. WebSockets
- Setting up WebSocket endpoints.
- Real-time communication use cases (e.g., chat apps).

### 2. GraphQL Integration
- Setting up GraphQL with libraries like `Graphene`.

### 3. Custom Authentication
- Implementing JWT-based authentication.
- Integrating third-party OAuth providers (e.g., Google, Facebook).

### 4. Advanced Dependency Injection
- Managing complex dependencies and configurations.
- Using `Depends` with classes and asynchronous dependencies.

### 5. API Versioning
- Managing multiple versions of an API.
- Best practices for versioning in FastAPI.

### 6. Custom OpenAPI Schema
- Modifying the OpenAPI schema.
- Adding custom metadata and tags.

### 7. Event Handling
- Using FastAPI's lifecycle events (`startup`, `shutdown`).
- Connecting event-driven architectures.

### 8. Performance Optimization
- Tuning Uvicorn settings.
- Caching with tools like Redis.
- Profiling and optimizing endpoints.

### 9. Microservices
- Building microservices with FastAPI.
- Communicating between services using message brokers like RabbitMQ or Kafka.

### 10. Serverless Deployment
- Deploying FastAPI apps on serverless platforms (e.g., AWS Lambda, Azure Functions).

### 11. Real-Time Applications
- Integrating WebSockets with Pub/Sub systems.
- Building dashboards and live updates.

### 12. Security
- Implementing advanced security headers (e.g., CORS, HSTS).
- Protecting APIs from attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).

### 13. Deployment
- Deploying FastAPI with Docker and Kubernetes.
- Setting up CI/CD pipelines.
- Using Nginx or Traefik as a reverse proxy.

### 14. Third-Party Libraries
- Exploring popular libraries like FastAPI Users, Piccolo ORM, and Celery for task queues.

### 15. Advanced Error Handling
- Global exception handlers.
- Customizing error responses.

## **Bonus Topics**
- API Gateway Integration.
- Building a full-stack application with FastAPI (frontend + backend).
- Extending FastAPI with plugins and reusable components.
